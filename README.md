## What is `fetch.py`? (The Brains of the Operation)

The `fetch.py` script is a high-quality Python tool that performs a crucial task: **It filters the noise out of the cryptocurrency news landscape to find high-value, SEO-worthy articles.**

It works by:

1.  **Multi-Source Aggregation:** Pulling articles from multiple RSS feeds and the CryptoPanic API.
2.  **Deep Web Scraping:** Using a combination of BeautifulSoup and `newspaper3k` to reliably extract the clean, full article text from diverse news sites.
3.  **Intelligent Scoring:** Applying a custom scoring algorithm based on:
    * **Source Authority** (e.g., Coindesk gets a higher score than a generic blog).
    * **High-Value Keywords** (e.g., "SEC," "ETF," "Binance" give a strong positive boost).
    * **Low-Value Keywords** (e.g., "Prediction," "Top 10," "Today's Update" give a strong penalty).
    * **Recency** and **Content Length**.
4.  **Caching:** Using a local `cache.json` file to prevent re-fetching or re-processing the same articles, saving time and API calls.

This script ensures that only the **top 10 most relevant, high-signal articles** are selected for the next stage of the pipeline (which, in the full application, is the **AI Rewriting Engine**).

## 🛠️ How to Run the Sample Script

### **1. Setup**

You will need **Python 3.8+** installed.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # (requires a requirements.txt file with: feedparser requests beautifulsoup4 newspaper3k)
    ```

2.  **Set Your API Key:**
    The script uses a placeholder API key for CryptoPanic. For the script to work reliably, you should replace the placeholder key:
    ```python
    # In fetch.py, update this line with your actual key if the placeholder fails
    CRYPTOPANIC_API_KEY = "34f5736b96c4c6aa74522bce23db1801ce9efa1f" 
    ```

### **2. Execution**

Run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python fetch.py


That's a great strategy. Since your goal is to showcase the power of the complete system and encourage users to purchase the full web app template, the best approach is:Placement: Place the full code in a separate file named fetch.py.README.md: Create a README.md file that briefly introduces the project, explains what fetch.py does, provides the necessary setup, and uses the script as a powerful demonstration to drive sales for the full template.Here is the complete README.md content, along with the fetch.py code block to be placed in its own file.1. The Recommended File StructureYou should create the script as a standalone file and reference it in the README.md:/
|-- fetch.py           <- Your full script goes here
|-- cache.json         <- Generated by fetch.py on first run
|-- news.json          <- Generated by fetch.py with the final articles
|-- README.md          <- The document below
|-- .gitignore
|-- requirements.txt   <- List of dependencies
2. requirements.txtBefore providing the README.md, you should create a simple requirements.txt file for the dependencies in fetch.py:Plaintextfeedparser
requests
beautifulsoup4
newspaper3k
3. The README.md ContentThis README.md is designed to be a highly effective landing page, showcasing the value of the backend logic while strongly encouraging the user to buy the complete, production-ready system.Markdown# 📰 AI News Aggregator Core: Data Fetcher & Scorer (`fetch.py`)

3. Output
The script will log its progress and, upon completion, will generate a file named news.json containing an array of the top 10 articles, fully scraped and scored, ready for the next step of AI rewriting and summarization.

🔑 The Missing Piece (Why You Need the Full Template)
The fetch.py script stops at collecting and filtering the raw data. This raw data is NOT suitable for direct publishing due to potential copyright issues and SEO penalties for duplicate content.

The full template completes the workflow, transforming raw data into a production-ready application:
